# Credit Card Fraud Detection

![Credit Card Fraud Detection]

Welcome to the Credit Card Fraud Detection repository! This project is dedicated to building a machine learning model for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. Credit card fraud is a common problem that affects both cardholders and financial institutions. Detecting fraudulent transactions is crucial to prevent financial losses and protect users.


## Introduction
Credit card fraud detection is an important task in the financial industry. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately identify fraudulent transactions. The model will help financial institutions and cardholders in flagging and preventing potential fraud.

## Dataset
We are using a publicly available credit card fraud dataset from [source link] which contains a large number of transactions made by credit cardholders. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with a small fraction of fraudulent transactions.

## Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, scaling, and handling class imbalance.
2. Feature Engineering: Creating relevant features for model training.
3. Model Selection: Using various machine learning algorithms and deep learning models.
4. Model Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. Results: Presenting the results and insights.
